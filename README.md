AP Computer Science A Final Project
By Benjamin Catalfo, Cliff Woo, Eric Yang, and Benjamin Catalfo

Ideas to Implement:
Different types of tiles (door tile, key tile to open door, wall tile, floor tile, metal (indestructible) door, portal tiles that take you to its corresponding tile)
Let the user make and share their own maps using serialization
Items (we can have a c4 item that can blow open a door even without a key, but you only have a limited amount of charges)
Soundtrack (Kanye would be awesome but you guys could put whatever music you want)
Minigames (for example you might have to play a minigame to open a certain door tile)
